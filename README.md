# SpotMicroAI Basic

This repository is for the people who are just looking to move SpotMicroAI robot with a remote controller.

Before you jump to advanced simulations you can use a simple RaspberryPi for your first build, so you will become familiar with the 3DParts, electronics, code and assembly process.

# The parts

To continue, we are going to assume you have at least the following components or very similar ones.

* 12 Servos MG996R 180ยบ
* 1 or 2 PCA9685
* DC to DC 5v output step down voltage regulator (a stepdown/stepup converter will give you longer work time)
* BEC 6v output (to feed the servos, if your servos can take your battery max voltage you don't need this component)
* 7.4 or 11.1v batteries with enough current to feed the servos
* A rocker switch
* 16x2 LCD Display Screen with I2C Module Interface Adapter
* RaspberryPi Zero W with headers soldered
* SD card
* XBox one or PS4 remote controller

Here you have how to wire up the components: https://gitlab.com/custom_robots/spotmicroai/electronics
